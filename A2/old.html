		<h1>Abby Podolsky: The Joker Resume</h1>
		<p>The Joker has a long-standing history of crime. In his early days, he was known as a lunatic, like every other villian was pictured in films. But, the Joker's character has now turned into a high-profile criminal genius. He is insane, and purely evil, but has a brilliant mind that harps on multiple methods, traps, and tools to get his evil jobs done. He is most well-known for fighting against Batman and destorying Gotham, starring in the movie The Dark Knight.</p>
